# Sea Battles
Sea Battles is a Python terminal game that runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. It is a one-player game where the user aims to hit all the randomly placed ships on the board. Each battleship occupies one square on the board. Sea Battleship is a turn-based game where you, as the player, try to hit and sink all the battleships on the game board. The game board is a grid consisting of squares, and each square represents a coordinate on the board.

## How to play Sea Battles ðŸŽ²
The objective of the game is to sink all the battleships within ten turns. In each turn, you will guess a coordinate by providing the row and column numbers. The top left corner of the board is represented by row 0 and column 0, while the bottom right corner is represented by row 6 and column 6.

After making your guess, the game will provide feedback on whether your guess was a hit or a miss. If you hit a battleship, the corresponding square on the board will be marked with an 'X' (representing a HIT). If you miss, the square will be marked with an 'O' (representing a MISS). You will also receive a message indicating whether it was a hit or a miss.

The game will continue for a maximum of ten turns or until you have sunk all the battleships on the board. If you manage to sink all the battleships within ten turns, you win the game. Otherwise, if you reach the maximum number of turns without sinking all the ships, the game ends.

Throughout the game, you can refer to the game board to see your previous guesses and the results. The 'X' marks represent your hits, and the 'O' marks represent your misses.
